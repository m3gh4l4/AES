# AES
AES stands for Advanced Encryption Standard.
AES algorithm is one of the most powerful algorithms that are widely used in different fields all
over the world. While a 56-bit DES key can be cracked in less than a day, AES would take billions of years to break using current computing technology.
In this project we implemented AES algorithm in verilog.
